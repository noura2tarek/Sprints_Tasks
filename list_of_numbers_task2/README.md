Task2 
Simple dart project categorize a list of numbers into even or odd, 
Using for loop and switch case.

Using List<int>, I stored my numbers.
And by using for loop, I iterate each number in the list, 
And checks if the number is even or odd using switch case.

My code in list_of_numbers_task2/bin/main_task2.dart
